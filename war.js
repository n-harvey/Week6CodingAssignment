/*
WAR
Rules
2 players with 26 cards each
Each round a player plays a card, highest card value win with Ace being the highest
In the event of a tie (war) each player plays a 2nd card 'facedown' and a 3rd card to resolve the tie, highest card wins
In the event the 3rd card ties again, another round of war is played
If a player does not have enough cards to complete the war that player loses
First player to run out of cards loses
